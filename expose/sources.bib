abstract="Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is an extension of the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) to other, well-chosen (first-order) theories such as integers, reals, and bit-vectors. This approach currently enjoys much popularity, especially in the field of software verification, where SMT solvers have become the de facto standard tool for the discharge of verification conditions. The development of parallel SMT solvers is still in its infancy, but the first general paradigms have been established. This chapter provides an overview of the recent advances in this area, specifically algorithm portfolio, search-space partitioning, and problem decomposition techniques, and how they relate to each other in theory and practice.",

abstract="With the availability of multi-core processors and large-scale computing clusters, the study of parallel algorithms has been revived throughout the industry. We present a portfolio approach to deciding the satisfiability of SMT formulas, based on the recent success of related algorithms for the SAT problem. Our parallel version of Z3 outperforms the sequential solver, with speedups of well over an order of magnitude on many benchmarks.",
