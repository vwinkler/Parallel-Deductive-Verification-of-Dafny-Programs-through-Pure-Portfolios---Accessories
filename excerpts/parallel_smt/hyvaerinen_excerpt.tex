        \textbf{Key questions}
    \end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}[i]
        \item What is the state of the art in parallel SMT solving?
        \item How successfull are parallel SMT solvers?
        \item Are they used particularly in software verification?
        \item Have (parallel) porfolios been used in SMT solving?
        \item How is diversification achieved?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{addmargin}

SMT solving is mentioned as the \enquote{traditional application field of SMT solvers}.
It is stated that SMT solving exhibits an inherent randomness
that lends itself to a parallel portfolio approach.
Previous work on SMT portfolios can be found in
\enquote{A Concurrent Portfolio Approach to SMT Solving} by Wintersteiger
which is reported to compare \enquote{favorably to many other portfolio-based approaches}.

% Figure 5.1 is an interesting presentation.

The paper exclaims:
\enquote{Sharing of learned lemmas plays a central role in parallel SMT.}
About three pages including some pseudocode is dedicated to this aspect.

The rest of the paper (about ten pages) highlights SMT solver parallelization strategies
other than portfolios.
These are search-space partitioning and decomposition,
A partitioning of a formula is an equivalent disjunction into formulas
whose pairwise conjunctions are unsatisfiable.
This entails that searching for a satisfying assignment at the same \enquote{coordinates}
is futile as one should expect from a partitioning.
Decomposition is introduced as an alternative to partitioning,
without this feature.
